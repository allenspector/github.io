            Over the last couple months, Walker Butte has partnered with three technology giants: Red Hat, Oracle, and Cisco, all these companies being in the top 5 of the most influential and the most prestigious software companies in the world. Additionally, Walker Butte has partnered with two of the most highly sought-after training and certification companies, having partnered with EC-Council, a high-end, global Cybersecurity certification and training organization, and having partnered with CompTIA, a global, vendor neutral certification and training organization. In each of these partnerships, our school has benefited because we have been provided the mort current curriculum, the best world class technology, the best books and resources, and an abundance of training materials for our teachers to implement the curriculum easily and seamlessly, the curriculum focusing on real world skills that could help students improve their technical sophistication or help students get gainful employment or help students get a head start in life. For these reasons, staff, teachers, and students are excited about next quarter and all the possibilities ahead.</p></div>

            <div class="head"><span class="headline hl5">What is Linux and Why should I learn it?</span><p><span class="headline hl6">Linux is Ubiquitious</span></p></div>
            From smartphones to cars, to supercomputers and home appliances, to home desktops and to enterprise servers, the Linux operating system is everywhere. It's used in cell phones, in thermostats, in cars, in refrigerators, Roku devices, in televisons, the Mars Rover, and so on. In fact, Linux is so powerful that Linux runs most of the Internet, having the majority of web servers use Linux, not only in the United States but also in the rest of the world. Additionally, the operating system is used in the world’s top 500 supercomputers, and in the world’s stock exchanges, and in the hospitality industry, and in the airline industry, and in the medical industry, and in many embedded devices too, these devices commonly referred to as the Internet of Things. </p> <p>Just like Windows and Apple, Linux can be run as a desktop, as a server, and as an embedded device, this operating system having been described as the most reliable, secure, and worry-free operating system available. </p>
			

            <p>In a nutshell, you should learn Linux it's free and opensource, and there is a thriving community of people willng to help, open source software being driven by communities of passionate and highly skilled individuals--with Linux being probably the most popular of them all. And most notably in this community, there are a great number of great jobs, making Linux a desirable skills for technologists and non-technologists.</p>

You might be reading this article on your cell phone or tablet, and if so, you are likely using open source technology right now. The operating systems for both iPhone and Android were originally created using building blocks from open source software, projects, and programs.

If you are reading this article on your laptop or desktop, are you using Chrome or Firefox as the web browser? Mozilla Firefox is an open source web browser. Google Chrome is a modified version of the open-source browser project called Chromium — though Chromium was started by Google developers who continue to play an active role in the updating and additional development, Google has added programming and features (some of which are not open source) to this base software to develop the Google Chrome browser. Still companies are lookhng at open source as a way  to produce the best and most reliable software, making Linux an important skill and making open source a more viable alternative for companies.</p>

        <div class="collumn"><div class="head"><span class="headline hl3">One Student's Opinion</span><p><span class="headline hl4">by AVID Staff Reporter</span></p></div><p>Our teacher, Mr. Spector has asked us to research Linux, talk to our classmates about Linux, and form our own opinion regarding it. For me, I want to learn Linux because I want to be a doctor, and I want to have the skills to be able to learn all the complicated, technical equipment. In addition, as Mr. Spector has pointed out, it's important to improve one's technical sophistication because the more technical we are, the easier it will be to figure out software in the future.</p><p>What surprised me the most is that Linux is everywhere, and I have noticed that I use Linux every day, even though I have never thought about it before. Although I'm still trying to process it, I'm glad to have been introduced to Linux in my AVID class--it was fun. </p><img class="emojidex-emoji" src="https://cdn.emojidex.com/emoji/seal/Tux.png" emoji-code="Tux" alt="Tux" /></div>
        <div class="collumn"><div class="head"><span class="headline hl1">The Linux Mascot</span><p><span class="headline hl4">by AVID Staff Reporter</span></p></div><p>Back in 1996, several members of a Linux group were chatting about a suitable logo and mascot for the new Linux operating system. At the time, many of the suggestions were nothing more than parodies of other operating system's logos. Other suggestions that were tosssed around were more related to nature, such as sharks and eagles. 

It wasn't until Linus Torvalds (the creator of Linux) mentioned that he was fond of penguins. That mention pretty much ended the debate and a penguin would become the mascot of Linux. And he is called Tux.</p>
